Photo Puzzle Game
Overview
The Photo Puzzle Game is an interactive, retro-themed web application built with Vue.js, designed to celebrate a special occasion with a birthday-themed experience. The game features a central hub, the Arcade Universe, from which players can access multiple mini-games: a sliding tile Photo Puzzle, an Asteroid Love shooter, a Star Maze navigation game, and a Vault with a PIN-based unlock mechanism. The application incorporates nostalgic 8-bit aesthetics, neon visuals, and engaging gameplay mechanics, including easter eggs and a secret love letter.
Features

Arcade Universe Hub: A central menu allowing navigation to different game modes.
Photo Puzzle: A sliding tile puzzle where players rearrange tiles to form a complete image. Difficulty levels range from Easy (2×2, 15 seconds) to Insane (5×5, 60 seconds).
Asteroid Love: A space shooter where players control a ship to shoot hearts at asteroids, progressing through five levels.
Star Maze: A maze navigation game where players collect hearts within a time limit, with an easter egg in level 4.
The Vault: A PIN-entry screen to unlock a special love letter, using a 6-digit code based on a birthdate (e.g., 260902 for 26 September 2002).
Retro Aesthetics: Features a CRT-style border, neon colors, and chiptune background music for an immersive retro experience.
Responsive Design: Optimized for both mobile and desktop devices, with dynamic resizing for smaller screens.
Easter Eggs: Includes a Konami code for a secret message and hidden love notes in the Arcade Universe.

Notes

The game requires an internet connection for loading Google Fonts and the chiptune audio.
The PIN for the Vault is hardcoded to 260902 (26 September 2002). Modify the checkVaultPassword function in App.vue to change the PIN.
Ensure the angel.jpg image is present in the public/ directory, as the Photo Puzzle will not display correctly without it.
The application is designed to be responsive, but optimal performance is achieved on screens wider than 360 pixels.

Troubleshooting

Image Not Displaying: Verify that angel.jpg is in the public/ directory and correctly referenced in the code.
Audio Not Playing: Check your browser's autoplay settings, as some browsers block audio without user interaction.
Game Not Loading: Ensure all dependencies are installed and the development server is running. Check the console for errors.
